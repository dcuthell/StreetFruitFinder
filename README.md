#### _The Street Fruit Finder helps users locate nut and fuit-bearing trees near them_

#### By _**David Cuthell**_

## Description

_The Street Fruit Finder gets its data from the most recent tree inventory created by the City of Portland's Department of Parks & Recreation. It assigns a latitude and longitude value for each tree in poor or better health and places a marker for it within a Google Map. Markers will cluster into groups for a less cluttered display. The user may filter results by selecting one or several tree type and health status. They may also learn more about the trees displayed by navigating to the about section._
